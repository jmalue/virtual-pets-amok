Setup
You can copy your code from the previous project to use as a starter, or start 
from scratch.


General
-Introduce ways to track:
-Cage cleanliness for organic dogs
-Shelter litter box cleanliness for organic cats
-Oil/maintenance level for robot animals
All classes
-Encapsulate all instance variables.
-Assign appropriate visibility modifiers to methods only used internally 
 by a class or within a class hierarchy.
-VirtualPet class and related subclasses/interfaces
-In addition to the last project’s requirements:

-Create a model that allows for dogs and cats, either of which may be robotic
-Introduce an attribute (instance variable) representing overall health that 
 is updated as a result of other attributes moving in a negative or positive 
 direction, influencing happiness
Introduce methods that allow for:
-oiling robotic pets
-walking dogs, decreasing the likelihood that organic dogs will soil their cages, 
 while increasing happiness in all dogs
Do not allow:
-Feeding/watering robotic pets
-Oiling organic pets
-Modify the tick method to return a value indicating the amount of waste a pet creates, 
 which should contribute to either (optionally, create accessor methods to 
 retrieve these values instead):
-Amount of waste in the litter box
-Amount of waste in an individual dog cage

VirtualPetShelter class

In addition to the last project’s requirements:
Introduce methods that allow for:
-Oiling/maintaining all robotic pets
-Cleaning dog cages
-Emptying the litterbox
-Modify existing methods to only feed/water pets that are not robotic
VirtualPetShelterApp class
In addition to the last project’s requirements:

add options to:
-Walk all dogs
-Clean dog cages
-Clean the shelter litterbox
-Oil all robotic pets
Tips
Remember: don’t get caught up in the user interface at first. Focus on shelter/pet 
behavior. Try to get one thing working at a time.
Try creating tests to verify pet behavior, limiting your immediate goal to something 
small.

Stretch Tasks
Allow for other types of pets. Are they caged? What maintenance do they require?
Allow an option for giving treats to pets. What sorts of treats do different pets like?
introduce a Cage class for each dog, where cleanliness is tracked, 
keying these on the dog to which each is assigned 
(to use a VirtualPet as a key in a HashMap, you should implement hashCode and equals)
Herd your cats.
(Note: the author is aware that it would not be a wise decision to allow all cats 
in a shelter to share a litterbox. They’re virtual pets, so virtually disease-free.)
